## Be avail of below points:

> the API endpoints is down ` http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/create` when I tests them. In case your api restrict cors call, so I also did proxy when api calls

> since I am testing them, API is not working that even if fails that I have auto-matically generate userId will display when api call finished(no matter succeed or fails)

> In the document requirement that said to provide DOB string but yesterday that I have a looked the API requirs ages as a number, so in collection that is DOB string, API requires that is the nubmer for the API

> In your tasks that you mentioned your expecting like material ui and didn't restrict to use library so I have used this UI library
